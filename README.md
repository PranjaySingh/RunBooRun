# RunBooRun

Run Boo Run is an endless runner i would create. Here in the Players would have to control a ghost
named BOO so as to prevent it from the Sacred Crushers that are tossed toward Boo.
Now the theme of the game is set in the early Black and White times where people believed in ghosts
and were actually afraid of them. But no one ever wondered that a what if ghosts also feared the
sacred practices and spell practiced by the humans.
This is the story of pitiful little Boo who is escaping these sacred spelled crushers
